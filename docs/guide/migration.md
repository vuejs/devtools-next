## Features Improvements

In v7, we've made some feature-level adjustments compared to v6. You can view the v7 feature overview in the [Features](/getting-started/features). Here, we mainly mention some of the main feature changes.

### Deprecated Features

Due to high performance costs and potential memory leak risks, we have removed some features in v7. These features are:

- `Performance` Timeline
- `Component Events` Timeline

💡 By the way, we are looking for a balanced approach to re-enable it with better performance. You can follow the latest progress [here](https://github.com/vuejs/devtools-next/issues/609).

### Feature Adjustments

- Timeline Tab

In v7, we moved the timeline tab to be managed within each plugin's menu. Here is a screenshot of the pinia devtools plugin:

## Plugin API

In v7, we are fully compatible with the v6 plugin API (Except type). You can check out the [v6 Plugin API documentation](https://devtools-v6.vuejs.org/plugin/api-reference.html) here.

Additionally, we have introduced some new plugin APIs. You can find more details [here](/plugins/api).
